"""A vendor's bank rule, set from the vendor form (#493).

A bookkeeper setting up a vendor usually knows the account every payment
to it takes. The vendor form's "Bank feed: lines from this payee post to
<the default expense account>" says so once: it makes the vendor's bank
rule (pattern = the vendor's name, Contains, any case; vendor_id = the
vendor; account = the default expense account) or updates the one it has,
and turns it off when unticked. The rule is an ordinary bank rule: the
Bank Rules page lists and edits it, and the engine treats it like any
other, naming the vendor on the lines it matches."""
